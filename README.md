# Image Downloader

Image downloader script finds image URLs previously scraped by Image Selector in a csv file and downloads them. Images are renamed to `<web-scraper-order>-<selector-name>.ext`. This version is a fork from [webscraper.io's original script](https://github.com/webscraperio/image-downloader). I have made some small tweaks:

- A Windows binary (.Exe) is available for those who cannot, or do not want to install Python.
- Changed the User-agent to the one for Chrome on Windows 10 64-bit (latest version as of end August 2023). The original script is reporting itself as "Chromium 63 on Ubuntu".
- Removed the 10-second delay when downloads are completed, and replaced it with a call to Windows' built-in Pause command. This will display "Press any key to continue..." instead of closing the console window after 10 seconds.
- Added a 0.25 second delay between each download. You can change or remove this in the source.
- A sample scrape results file, `sample-images-dl.csv` is available for testing. You can drag-n-drop this file on the .Exe or .py file for testing.
- Dropped support for Python 2. 

## Windows usage

1. \[OPTIONAL\] Download and install python 3.x from here:
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download image downloader .Exe and script from here:
[https://github.com/LeeMeng2020/image-downloader-lm/releases][image-downloader-releases]
3. Scrape the target site and export data in CSV format
4. Drag and drop the CSV file onto `image-downloader.exe`

5. Alternatively, if you have Python 3.x installed, drag and drop the CSV file onto `image-downloader.py`. On some computers, you may need to [enable drag & drop onto Python files](https://youtu.be/JrksuHFYrRE).

## MacOS, Linux usage

1. Install python if necessary through your package manager. Most likely you already have it preinstalled.
2. Download image downloader script from here:
[https://github.com/LeeMeng2020/image-downloader-lm][image-downloader]
3. Move `image-downloader.py` to `Downloads` directory
4. Scrape the target site and export data in CSV format
5. Save the CSV file in `Downloads` directory
6. Open `Terminal` application. You should have one preinstalled
7. Change working to `Downloads` directory by typing:
    ```bash
    cd Downloads
    ```
8. Run image downloader script by typing:
    ````bash
    python image-downloader scraped_data.csv
    ````

### PyInstaller settings for Windows .Exe

PyInstaller is [well documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). It is available for a few platforms. These setting were used to generate the Windows .Exe:
- PyInstaller version: 4.10
- Python version: 3.10.8
- PyInstaller command: pyinstaller --onefile --noupx image-downloader.py

### Antivirus/malware warning

Some anti-malware programs may warn about "unsigned app" or "no digital cert" for the Windows .Exe. This is a common issue for apps generated by PyInstaller. If you're in doubt, run an antivirus scan, or better yet, you can create the app yourself by using PyInstaller or just run the .py file. Note that PyInstaller requires Python to already be installed.
